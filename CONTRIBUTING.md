# Frontkit Contribution Guide

## Using the issue tracker
The GitHub issue tracker is a great tool that you can use for bug reports, feature requests and pull
requests. But we have a few conditions:

* Don't use it for personal support requests; [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) is a great
  community that has exactly this purpose.
* Keep the conversation on-topic. Trolling or personal stuff is not its purpose.

## Pull Requests
We appreciate any code contribution. However, we'd like you to follow some conventions:

### Commits
* We follow the [Angular.js commit message style](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit).
  Please keep it when commiting.
* Have you finished adding commits to your PR? If you're adding a feature, squash them.

### Testing
Be sure to __always__ test your code. This is very important to ensure that it will always work.

### Code Style
We have a well defined code style. Most deviations from our code style will be caught by
[JSCS](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs).
